* Requirements
  Run the following command:
  #+begin_src sh
  pip install flask requests
  #+end_src
* Running the application
  Inside the application directory, use the following command
  #+begin_src sh
  FLASK_APP=api flask run
  #+end_src
* Observations
  I was not able to figure out a way to test my app without calling
  your API. Furthermore, as python is not the most suited language for
  concurrency, my app queries your API serially. Actually, I should
  have used requests-futures or another similar library.
